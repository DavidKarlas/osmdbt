#  Disabled checks:
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay
#    Limited use and many false positives including for all asserts.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-pointer-arithmetic
#    This is a low-level library, it needs to do pointer arithmetic.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg
#  hicpp-vararg
#    The libc has some of these functions.
#
#  fuchsia-*
#    Much too strict.
#
#  google-runtime-references
#    This is just a matter of preference, and we can't change the interfaces
#    now anyways.
#
#  hicpp-no-array-decay
#    Alias for cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay.
#
#  readability-implicit-bool-conversion
#    I don't think this makes the code more readable.
